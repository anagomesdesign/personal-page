# Let's style!

Now that we have a basic understanding of how to create a React component, let's **style** it!<br/>
So far all you were able to create new components in JavaScript and render them in the browser.<br/>
Their styling however came all from the same `src/pages/index.css` file.<br/>
In order to have better organization and let each component be responsible for their own look, we need each to have its own CSS file.<br/>
