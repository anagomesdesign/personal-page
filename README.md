This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Environment dependencies:
- Node.js v18 or higher (project created on v20)


To check your Node.js version:

```bash
node -v
```

To run the local server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assignments

For every assignment, I suggest creating a new branch called `assignment/1-migrate-html-css`, `assignment/2-create-component` and so on. This way, you can keep track of your progress and have a clean codebase.

Once you think you've completed the assignment, push your branch and create a pull request to the `main` branch and I'll review it.

Hint: 
- vs code has a built-in git tool that can help you create branches and push your code.
- You can use the browser to create a pull request directly from the GitHub website.
- Before starting a new assignment, make sure to pull the latest changes from the `main` branch.
- I'm here to help you, so don't hesitate to ask questions.

### 1. Migrate an existing HTML/CSS project to Next.js

For this assignment, you'll be working solely on the `src/app/pages` directory. You'll grab any pure HTML/CSS project you've worked on in the past and migrate it into the `index.tsx` and `index.css` files. 

There is an existing "Hello World" that can be used as a reference.

Hint: 
- you only need to copy the `body` content of your HTML file into the `index.tsx` file.
